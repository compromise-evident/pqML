Version 4.1.0   Full automation.  (Options a,b,c,d loop other options, until  n%
                correct on classification.) No changes made to the python files!

Version 4.0.0   Using PyTorch. In very early versions, I used  C++  to build out
                a tiny NN from nothing but low-level math improvisation. And its
                training was random adjustments made after  all TD passed,  then
                adjustments reverted if number of misclassified went up.
